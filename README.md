## At a glance

| Area | What I build |
| --- | --- |
| Real-time engineering | Market data, event pipelines, reconciliation and stateful services |
| Backend & DevOps | Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, runbooks and health checks |
| AI-assisted development | Explicit GPT-5.6/Codex boundaries, local context and reproducible evidence |
| Automation | Discord/community tooling, APIs and operational workflows |
| Quality | Small measurable fixes, tests, audit trails and safe demo environments |

## Professional trajectory

### 2020–2023 · Community automation and bots

Early work focused on Python and JavaScript automation for Discord and gaming
communities: event handlers, moderation helpers, data utilities and bot
workflows. This period also included community operations and leadership in
Latin gaming spaces. Public-facing descriptions intentionally omit member
lists, private chats and financial records.

### 2024–2025 · APIs, exchange research and trading systems

The work expanded into FastAPI services, Bybit V5 integrations, orderbook
metrics, backtesting and operational tooling. The Adjudicator/Bybit project
family and related experiments explored order payloads, market data, error
handling, execution state and database persistence.

### 2026 · AI-assisted DevOps and evidence-first systems

Current work combines PostgreSQL, DuckDB, WebSockets, local agent tooling,
Trae/PyCharm workspaces, Qwen web/desktop experiments, Codex, GPT-5.6 and MCP.
The focus is not simply adding an LLM: it is making systems reproducible,
observable and explicit about the boundary between data, inference and
execution.

## Portfolio map

| Portfolio | Representative work | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community automation | Discord bots, gaming utilities and operational helpers | Historical / selected public projects |
| Exchange engineering | Adjudicator, Bybit V5, orderbook and execution experiments | Active research lineage |
| Metrics and formulas | TSM exchange formulas, Discover Metrics, predictive snapshots | Active research / private workspaces |
| AI development tools | Qwen web/desktop experiments, local agents, MCP and Context Bridge | Local and experimental |
| Developer platforms | FastAPI services, Python IDE prototypes and operational APIs | Active / maintained selectively |
| Control plane | NerTzh Metrics Control Plane | Current flagship |

Private workspaces and historical backups are not linked as public projects
until their licenses, dependencies, credentials and reproducibility are
reviewed.

## Flagship: NerTzh Metrics Control Plane

<a href="https://github.com/NerTzhuLz/NerTzh"><img align="right" width="360" src="https://github.com/NerTzhuLz/NerTzh/raw/main/assets/branding/logo.png" alt="NerTzh"/></a>

An evidence-first local control plane for Bybit spot metrics, Context Bridge
state and optional protected GPT-5.6/Codex-assisted analysis.

- FastAPI judge surface on `:8081` with a responsive monitoring UI.
- Optional attended Bybit demo engine isolated on `:8082`.
- PostgreSQL for engine state; DuckDB + Markdown for local context.
- Read-only by default; no automatic model calls or live execution.
- Reconciliation across market, database and exchange state.

## Selected work

- **Trading infrastructure:** NerTzh, Adjudicator/Bybit research, TSM exchange
  formulas and state-reconciliation experiments.
- **Developer platforms:** FastAPI services, Python automation and local agent
  tooling.
- **Community automation:** Discord bots and operational tools dating back to
  2020.
- **Organization:** [NerThzBottZq](https://github.com/NerThzBottZq) for shared
  experiments and developer tooling.

Private or historical projects remain private until their dependencies,
licenses, credentials and reproducibility are reviewed.

## Engineering principles

1. Reconcile market, database and exchange state before acting.
2. Prefer a small, measurable correction over a large rewrite.
3. Keep credentials and private community data out of public repositories.
4. Make automation observable, attended and reversible.
5. Document the boundary between evidence, inference and execution.

## Technical surface

Representative technologies and public code surfaces from the active systems:

| Layer | Technologies / APIs |
| --- | --- |
| Languages | Python, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Shell |
| Backend | FastAPI, Uvicorn, aiohttp, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy |
| Storage | PostgreSQL, DuckDB, JSON/JSONL, SQL migrations |
| Market connectivity | Bybit V5 REST, WebSocket orderbook/trades, HMAC signing, retry and reconciliation |
| Operations | Docker Compose, Make, systemd diagnostics, health checks, GitHub Actions, FFmpeg/Playwright |
| AI tooling | Codex, GPT-5.6 protected routes, Context Bridge, MCP, Qwen web/desktop experiments |
| Frontend | Native responsive HTML/CSS/JS, Chart.js, SVG/canvas visualizations |

Representative classes, functions and routes include `BybitV5Client`,
`BybitMcpSession`, `ConfigSettings`, `MarketData`, `Orderbook`, `Trade`,
`MetricSnapshot`, `BalanceSnapshot`, `ThresholdSnapshot`, `GPTClient`,
`MLPrediction`, `ChatIn`, `agent_context`, `bridge_status`, `agent_chat`,
`build_spot_order_body`, `create_order`, `cancel_order`, `amend_order`,
`order_realtime`, `order_history`, `get_open_orders`, `train_from_rows`,
`predict`, `compute_indicators`, and `combined_from_weights`.

### Nautilus Trader — evaluation track

Nautilus Trader is **not installed or referenced in the current `_Metrics_`
runtime**. It is an evaluation target for adapting the existing metrics and
reconciliation layer to a more formal event-driven trading architecture. The
intended study areas are adapters, `Actor`/`Strategy` lifecycle, data and order
events, execution clients, and backtest/live parity. No Nautilus production or
performance claim is made until a dedicated prototype is implemented and
tested.
